            <p class="card-text">Jihad (English: /dʒɪˈhɑːd/; Arabic: جهاد‎ jihād [dʒɪˈhaːd]) is an Arabic word which
                literally means striving or struggling, especially with a praiseworthy aim.[1][2][3][4] In an Islamic
                context, it can refer to almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God's guidance,
                such as struggle against one's evil inclinations, proselytizing, or efforts toward the moral betterment
                of the ummah,[1][2][5] though it is most frequently associated with war.[6] In classical Islamic law,
                the term refers to armed struggle against unbelievers,[2][3] while modernist Islamic scholars generally
                equate military jihad with defensive warfare.[7][8] In Sufi and pious circles, spiritual and moral jihad
                has been traditionally emphasized under the name of greater jihad.[9][3] The term has gained additional
                attention in recent decades through its use by terrorist groups.

                The word jihad appears frequently in the Quran with and without military connotations,[10] often in the
                idiomatic expression "striving in the path of God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)".[11][12] Islamic jurists
                and other ulema of the classical era understood the obligation of jihad predominantly in a military
                sense.[13] They developed an elaborate set of rules pertaining to jihad, including prohibitions on
                harming those who are not engaged in combat.[14][15] In the modern era, the notion of jihad has lost its
                jurisprudential relevance and instead given rise to an ideological and political discourse.[7] While
                modernist Islamic scholars have emphasized defensive and non-military aspects of jihad, some Islamists
                have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical theory.[7]</p>
